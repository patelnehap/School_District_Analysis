## Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of the school district analysis is to find trends and view the overall performance summaries of each school in the district. When reviewing the prformances, the school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were ialtered and they requested for updated data summaries. After further discussion, it was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact.

Both math and reading scores were replaced with "NaN", which represents a "Not-a-Number" value, for 461 student records. Although this may seem like a significant number, these score replacements did not alter data summaries tremendously overall.

The school board asked for the data to be removed and analyzed again for a comparison.
